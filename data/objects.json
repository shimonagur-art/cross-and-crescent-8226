      "body": "\"The Luck of Edenhall\" is a glass produced in the Islamic world that eventually made its way to the Musgrave family, who resided in Edenhall, Cumberland. The glass was historically believed to have been brought back through Crusaders returning from their conquests, however, we now know it was only built nearly a century after the last Crusade. The glass also had a case built almost a century after its creation, which has the phrase \"Jesus, Saviour of Mankind\" inscribed in Latin - displaying a religious message to those who saw it as well as highlighting the value of the glass (as it was deemed important enough to have a protective layer). This object is thus a perfect example of the long-term blend between conquest, culture and commerce between Islam and Christianity, as its journey as well as the myths surrounding it cover the basis of all of thee connections.",
